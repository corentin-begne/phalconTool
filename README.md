## Installation

#### Requirement
- [Phalcon = 4.0](https://phalconphp.com/fr/download)
- php >=7.2

using composer
```
{
    "require": {
        "v-cult/phalcon": "dev-master",
        "google/apiclient": "1.1.7"
    }
}
```

Create a phalcon symlink to application.php in your root project folder  
```
cd /var/www/project/
ln -s vendor/v-cult/phalcon/application.php ./phalcon
```
or in /usr/bin to be used globally
```
sudo ln -s /var/www/project/vendor/v-cult/phalcon/application.php /usr/bin/phalcon
```

## Upgrade v3 project to v4

You need to 
- Replace Phalcon\Mvc\User\Plugin and Phalcon\Mvc\User\Component by Phalcon\DI\Injectable
- Add $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] as parameter of the handle function in public/init.php
- Regenerate models
- Update jsHelpers with bower
- Check about $model::findFirst it return NULL and longer false if the result is not found
- Replace in SecurityPlugin.php Phalcon\Dispatcher by Phalcon\Dispatcher\Exception to get constants
- Update apps/x/config/servces.php to change Url, Routes, Session and Translation according to [services.php](https://github.com/corentin-begne/phalconTool/blob/master/templates/project/app/config/services.php)
- If project had ACL update it according to [SecurityPlugin.php](https://github.com/corentin-begne/phalconTool/blob/master/templates/project/app/plugins/SecurityPlugin.php)

## Quick start

For all commands, you can specify the environment and application with options --env= and --app=   
The default values are dev/frontend

### Create project
```
phalcon generate:project
```
It will create apps and public dir in the root project folder initialized with frontend application.  
The Document root of the server must be the public dir.  
By default api and scrud libraries are enabled and the project is secured by google user connect so you need to create a google application, authorize google+ api and generate devKey, client_id and client_secret to set them inside the configuration file.  
The default action user/login redirect to the google user authentification to log in the application and redirect to the SCRUD index (in progress).

### Generate models
Before generate models, don't forget to modify the config.php in your app folder.
On generation, if the databse is empty, it will import the ones used for the User management.
```
phalcon models:generate
```
Models will be created from the database with column map and all relations.
By default scrud is no activated, you need to add in config.php inside librairies field api and scrud and add them to the private or public ressources.
You're now able to access to SCRUD action for all model, example for User :
```
http//localhost/scrud/User/read?id=1
http//localhost/scrud/User/create
http//localhost/scrud/User/search
```
You can merge all model which has one relation for example if you add UserProfil table like this :
```
http//localhost/scrud/User UserProfil/read?id=1
http//localhost/scrud/User UserProfil/create
http//localhost/scrud/User UserProfil/search
```
So you can set as model as hasOne relations exists.

### Generate controllers and actions
You can specify one or more action associated with the controller, by default the views associated with the actions are created but the option --no_view=true block this.
```
phalcon generate:controller home index,test
```
It will create the home controller with the index et test actions with their views.

### Generate tasks
As the same way as the controllers, you can create task with all action in the same time
```
phalcon generate:task video convert,purge
```
Then this task will be accessible like others
```
phalcon video:purge
```

### Generate Less/Css, Sass/Scss and Js
The asset manager set default collection css and js, a main css file that should be generated by less and 2 js files, jquery and the main that initialize the page.
These collection are include inside the default layout.
For each module action, you can generate css/less, scss/sass and js files on the same way as the controller :
```
phalcon generate:css home index,test
phalcon generate:scss home index,test
phalcon generate:js home index,test
```
It will copy the type template in public/[type]/[moduleName]/[actionName] or in the [moduleName] root folder for the index action.
For the css minifier, I use sublime with Less2Css that compile and minify less file on save but there a command to do that using lessc node module (sudo npm install lessc -g)
```
phalcon generate:less home
phalcon generate:less home index,test
```
The first command will get all main.less inside the home module and compile/minify them.
The second command will only do the job for the actions listed
Same for sass, need to install ruby and a sublime plugin to compile with ctrl+b.
```
phalcon generate:sass home
phalcon generate:sass home index,test
```

### Generate Js build
You can generate a javascript build in one file for each controller/action.
```
phalcon generate:build home index,test // for action index and test of the home controller
phalcon generate:build home // for each action of home controller
phalcon generate:build // for each controller and action
```
Don't forget to specify the environnement and application with --app= --env= in dev and preprod environnement the build files aren't uglified.  
So it generate a build.js file in the action directory, it will be automaticaly used in the production environnement.

### Websocket
There's a websocket server with room and users management supporting ssl connection which could be start on command line :
```
phalcon server:start
```
A websocket Javascript library is available to work with, accessible in the bower_components, it just recreate user events management and can be used like this :
```
websocket.connect("wss://"+document.domain+":9000/myRoom", {"id":new Date().getTime()}).then(success).catch(error);

function error(event){
    console.error(event);
}

function success(){
    websocket.setEvents({
        "test": test,
        "userConnected": userConnected,
        "userDisconnected": userDisconnected,
        "connected": ready
    });
    websocket.send("test", {yo:"yo"});
    

    function test(data){
        console.log("receive test event", data);
    }

    function userConnected(data){
        console.log("new user connected", data);
    }

    function userDisconnected(data){
        console.log("user leave room", data);
    }

    function ready(data){
        console.log("connected to room", data);
    }
}
```

### Translation
Inside each view you can use $t->_ or $t->__ to get translation from key inside array from folder messages. The language used corresponding to the browser language using en by default.
$t->_ is used to acces direct key value from the array and $t->__ is more specific for the same key but inside the controller / action context.  
Functions are from the controller so inside the action use $this->__ and $this->_ to access to the translations.
```
view inside controller user action login
$t->_('hi') // $messages['hi']
$t->__('hi') // $mesages['user_login_hi']
```
You can use scrud to manage translation using the LangMessage default table and the task to import/export data :
```
http://localhost/backend/scrud/LangMessage/search // on backend app
phalcon message:import
phalcon message:export // can be used with --save option to keep a save of the last files version
```

### Migration
The migration system is based on annotations and modification made in the models and report the difference from the database.
```
phalcon migration:generate
```
Once its done, you can run the migration 
```
phalcon migration:run
```
On run, it will execute all the migration from the current version (env_version) to the last.
Then you can rollback one by one
```
phalcon migration:rollback
```
or rollback until a specific version
```
phalcon migration:rollback 1
```
You can also create a model template 
```
phalcon generate:model test
```

### Data Export
Run this command to export tables from the database, if you leave the param empty all tables will be exported.
Tables will be exported as csv in the dump folder.
```
phalcon data:export User
```

### Data Import
All csv in the dump folder will be imported, add truncate option to truncate table before import else it will do a replace based on the primary key.
```
phalcon data:import --truncate
```

### Make a release and send to env server
There's a task made for, you just need to specify the environnement and tag number.
Before you need to create a branch associated with the environnement which will be pushed.    
The task will use the environnement branch to create the branche version and rsync all the content to the ssh server set in the config.  
The task will compile all sass file by default (if you use less add --compile_less option) and make all js builds.
```
phalcon release prod 0.0.1 --env=prod
```
